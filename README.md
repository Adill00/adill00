### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing a Weather forecast/nowcast application on React Native Expo, leveraging my skills and expertise in frontend and backend development.

  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the intricacies of Cross Platform Mobile Development specifically focusing on React Native, aiming to broaden my proficiency in mobile app development and enhance my capabilities in delivering robust and user-friendly applications.


- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on React Native projects, where I can contribute my knowledge and collaborate with fellow developers to create innovative and impactful mobile applications.

Feel free to ask for collaboration on repositories that need maintenance or for something else, I am open to opportunities.
